# Hydration-App
The Hydration Reminder App is a digital tool designed to help users maintain proper hydration throughout the day by sending them timely reminders to drink water. Dehydration can lead to various health issues, including fatigue, headaches, and impaired cognitive function. This app aims to address these concerns by encouraging users to drink water at regular intervals.

Key Features:

Customizable Reminders: Users can set their preferred reminder intervals based on their hydration needs and preferences. Common options include reminders every 30 minutes, every hour, or custom intervals.

Visual and Audible Reminders: The app sends reminders in two formats. Visual reminders appear as pop-up notifications on the user's device screen. Audible reminders include pleasant sound alerts to catch the user's attention.

Water Consumption Tracker: The app allows users to track their daily water intake. They can input the quantity of water they've consumed, and the app will keep a running total throughout the day.

Hydration Tips: To promote healthy habits, the app may include a section with informative tips about the importance of staying hydrated, optimal water intake levels, and the benefits of drinking water.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures users can access and interact with the app wherever they are.

Technology Stack:

Front-end: The app's user interface is typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript powers the interactive elements and reminder functionality.

Local Storage: The app may use browser local storage to save user preferences and hydration records locally on the user's device. This allows the app to maintain reminders and tracking even if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page.
